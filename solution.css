Several alternative and more robust clearfix methods exist.  Here are two examples:

**Method 1: Using `overflow: auto`:**

```css
.clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}
```

This method is often preferred for its simplicity and broad compatibility.

**Method 2: Using `after` pseudo-element with more modern properties:**

```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

This replaces `display: table` with the simpler `display: block;` while maintaining similar functionality. This is generally well-supported and less likely to cause problems.  Choose the method that best suits your project's needs and browser compatibility requirements.
