The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}

.clearfix::after {
  content: '';
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}

/* ... rest of the CSS ... */
```

The `clearfix` hack, while common, can cause issues with some layout engines and older browsers.  The issue isn't always apparent, but might manifest as unexpected collapsing of floated elements or incorrect positioning.  The `display: table` approach, in particular, can lead to subtle rendering differences.
